Themes: we will ship only the very best looking themes. We won't ship everything that Debian ships, just a custom package that includes the themes we want. These packages are included for size guidance until we have Ubuntu-specific packages.

 * ubuntu-artwork
 * ubuntu-sounds
 * gnome-session-canberra	# Needed to make login/logout sounds audible.

The gstreamer0.10 packages we want to install:

 * gstreamer0.10-alsa
 * gstreamer0.10-plugins-base-apps

For Ubuntu we need libsdl1.2debian-pulseaudio for the above gstreamer0.10-plugins-base-apps < libtheora-dev < libsdl1.2-dev < libsdl1.2debian.

 * libsdl1.2debian # tiny and needed for clean CDROM upgrades
