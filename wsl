Packages needed or useful in Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) installations.

The WSL environment is somewhere between a chroot and a container.
The Ubuntu installation runs processes in a root file system separate from the
Windows root file system, but it can interact with the Windows programs sharing
the network interfaces including localhost and via Unix sockets.

The WSL environment does not need tools for setting up boot and does not run
systemd at the moment.
