= Documentation =

We need a consistent policy for -doc. At the least, any -doc package produced by a source package that also generates a binary package in one of our seed lists should absolutely go into supported.

 * doc-linux-html          # ColinWatson; basic HOWTOs and stuff from LDP
 * manpages-dev            # ColinWatson
 * diveintopython
 * diveintopython-zh
 * autoconf-doc
 * %texlive-doc
 * texlive-font-utils
 * texlive-bibtex-extra
 * texlive-fonts-extra
 * texlive-publishers
 * texlive-science

 * gimp-help-en
 * gimp-help-de
 * gimp-help-sv
 * gimp-help-fr
 * gfortran-doc
 * doc-linux-text
 * exim4-doc-html
 * libstdc++6-4.4-doc

These *-doc packages are in separate source packages, so Extra-Includes won't catch them and they need to be listed explicitly.

 * bison-doc
 * gawk-doc
 * gdb-doc
 * gnupg-doc
 * make-doc
 * python-gtk2-doc

It's useful to have these on the DVD so that it can be used as an
apt source for upgrades.
