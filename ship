== Kernel ==

 * linux [amd64 i386]

== Desktop ==

A small first step to comprehensive certification. Unfortunately, lsb
includes lsb-desktop, which pulls in both gtk and qt, so we pick individual
modules instead.

 * lsb-core [amd64 i386]
 * lsb-cxx [amd64 i386]
 * lsb-graphics [amd64 i386]

== Server ==

 * ssh
 * nfs-kernel-server   # need an NFS server
 * ltsp-server-standalone [amd64 i386] # for LTSP-on-install
 * ltsp-client [amd64 i386]            # for LTSP-on-install
 * ldm [amd64 i386] # seeded because its not a hard dependency of ltsp-client anymore
 * ldm-ubuntu-theme [amd64 i386] # seeded to make it available for LTSP-on-install

== Networking ==

 * bsd-mailx
 * vlan                   # userland tools to config 8021q support

== Development ==

 * build-essential
 * fakeroot
 * bzr [i386]          # amd64 CD overflowing, and the package became a hog

== Common UNIX stuff ==

 * nfs-common		  # allows people to access NFS filesystems
 # * vim                    # vim-tiny is in minimal; vim includes syntax highlighting, help files, etc.

== Hardware & Network Access ==

 * pptp-linux             # client for Microsoft-compatible VPN's, needed for some ISPs
 * eagle-usb-utils        # needed for some ADSL modems
 * bpalogin
 * ndiswrapper-utils-1.9 [amd64 i386]
 * ndisgtk

 * linux-wlan-ng
 * libatm1	# suggested by ppp for PPP-over-ATM
 * setserial	# needed by folks with nonstandard serial ports
 * b43-fwcutter

== Common language packs ==

 # must have
 * Languages: en
 * language-pack-${Languages}
 * language-pack-gnome-${Languages}
 * language-support-${Languages}

Enough room on amd64 armel i386, not enough on powerpc:
 * Languages: es xh pt de
 * language-pack-${Languages} [!powerpc]
 * language-pack-gnome-${Languages} [!powerpc]

 * Languages: fr
 * language-pack-${Languages} [i386]
 * language-pack-gnome-${Languages} [i386]

# * Languages: bn hi ar ru zh-hans ja
# * language-pack-${Languages}
# * language-pack-gnome-${Languages}

== Installer ==

 * grub # needed for dmraid et al
 * oem-config-gtk
 * oem-config-slideshow-ubuntu
 * uboot-mkimage [armel]

== Transitional packages ==

== Germinate workarounds ==

 * wamerican  # iamerican Depends: ispell Recommends: wordlist, but wamerican isn't spotted in time so germinate arbitrarily picks miscfiles instead

== Blacklist ==

libavcodec cannot be shipped on CDs (cf. Ubuntu technical board resolution 2007-01-02).

 * !libavcodec*
