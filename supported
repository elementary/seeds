Most of what was formerly in the supported seed is now in the dvd seed. This
seed now includes some things that are too big for a DVD, and of course also
inherits from everything else.

= Language support =

The following packages also have application translations, but are not
using gettext, but a custom format. language-selector will install
them as appropriate.

 * /^gimp-help-/
 * /^evolution-documentation-/
 * /^libreoffice-help-/
 * /^libreoffice-l10n-/
 * /^thunderbird-locale-/
 * poppler-data

The following input aids are also installed on demand by
language-selector:

 * mozvoikko
 * openoffice.org-voikko
 * openoffice.org-hyphenation
 * /^gnome-user-guide-/
 * /^hyphen-..$/
 * hyphen-en-us
 * /^mythes-/

Transitional packages:

 * /^openoffice.org-help-/
 * /^openoffice.org-l10n-/
 * /^openoffice.org-thesaurus-/
 * /^openoffice.org-hyphenation-/
